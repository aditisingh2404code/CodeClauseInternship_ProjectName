# 🍳 Recipe Book App

Because food > everything else.  
This is your **digital grandma’s recipe diary**, minus the bad handwriting and turmeric stains.  

---

## ✨ Features
- 🥗 Add your own recipes (yes, even Maggi counts).  
- 📸 Upload pictures to flex your burnt rotis.  
- 🔍 Search & filter recipes (finally find that one “aloo” dish).  
- ⭐ Star your favs (so you don’t forget the only thing you know how to cook).  
- 📊 Analytics (see which dish is your real MVP).  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone repo (because copy-paste recipes isn’t enough).  
2. Backend → `npm install && node server.js`.  
3. Frontend → `npm install && npm run dev`.  
4. Open browser → Cook something → Profit 🍕

## 🧐 Why?
Because asking your mom “How to make chai?” on call every day is not scalable.  
Now you can pretend to be Gordon Ramsay while actually just making toast. 🍞🔥
