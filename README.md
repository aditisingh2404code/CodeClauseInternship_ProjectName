# 🍴 My Recipe Book  

Welcome to **My Recipe Book** — a web app that lets you add, view, edit, and delete recipes.  
Think of it as your grandma’s handwritten cookbook, but with less oil stains and more JavaScript.  

---

## ✨ Features  
- 📝 **Add Recipes** – because your future self won’t remember that “secret pasta trick.”  
- 🔍 **Search Recipes** – find what you’re craving faster than Zomato.  
- 👀 **View Recipes** – see full ingredients & instructions in style.  
- ✏️ **Edit Recipes** – made a mistake? Don’t worry, even Gordon Ramsay edits.  
- ❌ **Delete Recipes** – for those failed experiments (looking at you, burnt brownies).  
- 💾 **Local Storage** – your recipes stay saved even if you close the tab.

## 🥘 Built With  
- **HTML5** – structure (the skeleton 🦴).  
- **CSS3** – styling (the glam 💅).  
- **JavaScript** – brains of the operation 🧠.  
- **LocalStorage** – memory that never forgets… unlike me.
